# What do the commands `chmod` and `chown` accomplish in a Linux environment?
?
`chmod` modifies the file access permissions for users and groups, while `chown` changes the ownership of a file or directory to a specific user and/or group.

# What are Linux capabilities and how can they enhance system security?
?
Linux capabilities divide root privileges into smaller, manageable units that processes can use based on their specific needs. These capabilities allow for operations like binding to privileged ports without root access and minimizing privileges to enhance security, supporting the principle of least privilege.
